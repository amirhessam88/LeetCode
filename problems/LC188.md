## Problem:  Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

## Difficulty: Hard

## Description:
You are given an integer array prices where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `k`. Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most `k` transactions. Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

## Examples:
```
Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.

```

```
Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
```

## Constraints:
```
0 <= k <= 100
0 <= prices.length <= 1000
0 <= prices[i] <= 1000
```

## Solutions:
There are multiple DP approach but I found this approach so simple. We need to have two arrays with the size of `k` to store minimum price and profits at the `ith` transaction. So, the first element of the arrays always get upadated per each price in the `prices` array. This solution has a time complexity of `O(Nk)` and space complexity of `O(k)` where `N` is the size of `prices` array and `k` is the number of transactions.


```python
def maxProfit(k, prices):
    """
    :type k: int
    :type prices: List[int]
    :rtype: int
    :Time Complexity: O(N * k)
    :Space Complexity: O(k)
    """

    if k == 0 or len(prices) == 0:
        return 0

    min_price = [float("inf")] * k
    profit = [float("-inf")] * k

    for price in prices:
        min_price[0] = min(min_price[0], price)
        profit[0] = max(profit[0], price - min_price[0])
        for i in range(1, k):
            min_price[i] = min(min_price[i], price - profit[i - 1])
            profit[i] = max(profit[i], price - min_price[i])

    return profit[-1]

```
