## Problem: Climbing Stairs

## Difficulty: Easy

## Description:
You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

## Examples:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

## Constraints:
```
1 <= n <= 45
```

## Solutions: 
For the DP approach we create an array of size `n+1` and for all possible values from `1 to n` we calculate the number of ways using `1 or 2`. In the meantime, we store all the values and skip the double counting. The final element of the array will be the answer. The solution has time and space complexity of `O(n)`.

```python
def climbStairs(n):
    """
    :type n: int
    :rtype: int
    :Time Complexity: O(N)
    :Space Complexity: O(N)
    """
    climbs = [1, 2]
    dp = [0] * (n+1)
    dp[0] = 1

    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for c in climbs:
            if i - c >= 0:
                dp[i] += dp[i-c]

    return dp[-1]
```
