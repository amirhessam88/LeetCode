## Problem: Combination Sum IV

## Difficulty: Medium

## Description:
Given an array of distinct integers `nums` and a target integer `target`, return the number of possible combinations that add up to target.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
## Examples:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = 4
Output: 7
Explanation:
The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)
Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
```

```
Input: nums = [9], target = 3
Output: 0
```

## Constraints:
```
1 <= nums.length <= 200
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
All the elements of nums are unique.
1 <= target <= 1000
```

## Solutions: 
We can use dynamic programming to create an array with a length of `(1 + target)` to store all the values. The time complexity would be `O(N * M)` and space complexity would be `O(M)` where `N` is the lenght of array `nums` and `M` is the `target` value. 

```python
def combinationSum4(nums, target):
    """
    :type nums: List[int]
    :type target: int
    :rtype: int
    :Time Complexity: O(N * M)
    :Space Complexity: O(M)
    """
    dp = [0] * (target + 1)
    dp[0] = 1

    for i in range(1, target + 1):
        for n in nums:
            if i - n >= 0:
                dp[i] += dp[i - n]

    return dp[-1]

```
