## Problem: Valid Parentheses

## Difficulty: Easy

## Description:
Given a string s containing just the characters `'(', ')', '{', '}', '[',  ']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
## Examples:
```
Input: s = "()"
Output: true
```

```
Input: s = "([)]"
Output: false
```

## Constraints:
```
1 <= s.length <= 10^4
s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.
```

## Solutions: 
To solve this problem we can use the stack data strucutre and keep it always empty for the valid `s` unless it will be invalid. The time and space complexity is `O(N)` where `N` is the length of `s`.

```python
def isValid(s):
    """
    :type s: str
    :rtype: bool
    :Time Complexity: O(N)
    :Space Complexity: O(N)
    """
    dct = {"(": 1, ")": -1, "[": 2, "]": -2, "{": 3, "}": -3}
    stack = []

    for char in s:
        val = dct[char]
        if val > 0:
            stack.append(val)
        elif len(stack) > 0 and stack[-1] + val == 0:
            stack.pop()
        else:
            return False

    return True if len(stack) == 0 else False

```
