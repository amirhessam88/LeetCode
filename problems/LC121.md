## Problem:  Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## Difficulty: Easy

## Description:
You are given an array prices where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

## Examples:
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

## Constraints:
```
1 <= prices.length <= 10^5
0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4
```

## Solutions:
For the DP approach, we should track the minimum price and the maximum profit while we traverse the `prices` array. This solution would have a time complexity of `O(N)` and space complexity of `O(1)` where `N` is the size of `prices` array.

```python
def maxProfit(prices):
    """
    :type prices: List[int]
    :rtype: int
    :Time Complexity: O(N)
    :Space Complexity: O(1)
    """
    if not prices:
        return 0

    max_profit = 0
    min_price = prices[0]
    for i in range(1, len(prices)):
        min_price = min(min_price, prices[i])
        max_profit = max(max_profit, prices[i] - min_price)

    return max_profit

```
