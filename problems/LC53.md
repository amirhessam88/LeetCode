## Problem: Max Subarray

## Difficulty: Easy

## Description:
Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

## Examples:
```
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

```
Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
```

## Constraints:
```
1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
```

## Solutions: 
The naive appraoch is always to produce all of the subarrays and find the one that meets the objective. This approach has a time complexity of `O(N^3)` and space complexity of `O(N^2)` where `N` is the size of array.

```python
def maxSubArray(nums):
    """
    :type nums: List[int]
    :rtype: int
    :Time Complexity: O(N^3)
    :Space Complexity: O(N^2)
    """
    sums = []
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i, len(nums)):
            sub = nums[i : j + 1]
            sums.append(sum(sub))

    return max(sums)
```

For the optimal solution, we can use the Kadane's algorithm. This approach has a time complexity of `O(N)` and space complexity of `O(1)` where `N` is the size of array.
```python
def maxSubArray(nums):
    """
    :type nums: List[int]
    :rtype: int
    :Time Complexity: O(N)
    :Space Complexity: O(1)
    """
    current_max = global_max = nums[0]

    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        current_max = max(current_max + nums[i], nums[i])
        global_max = max(current_max, global_max)

    return global_max
```
