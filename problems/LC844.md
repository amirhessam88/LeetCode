## Problem: Backspace String Compare

## Difficulty: Easy

## Description:
Given two strings `S` and `T`, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. `#` means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

## Examples:
```
Input: S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "ac".
```

```
Input: S = "ab##", T = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "".
```

## Constraints:
```
1 <= S.length <= 200
1 <= T.length <= 200
S and T only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.
```

## Solutions: 
To solve this problem we can use define a helper function to preprocess each string and apply the escape character. At the end if the preprocessed strings are the same, we return `True`. The time and space complexity is `O(N + M)` where `N` is the length of `S` and `M` is the lenght of `T`.

```python
def backspaceCompare(S, T):
    """
    :type S: str
    :type T: str
    :rtype: bool
    :Time Complexity: O(N + M)
    :Space Complexity: O(N + M)
    """

    def helper(word):
        seen = []
        for char in word:
            if char == "#":
                if len(seen) > 0:
                    seen.pop()
            else:
                seen.append(char)

        return "".join(seen)

    return True if helper(S) == helper(T) else False

```
